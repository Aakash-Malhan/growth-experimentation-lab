A/B Testing + CUPED + Retention Analytics + Churn Modeling (Real Dataset: Cookie Cats)

This project simulates a real-world product experimentation workflow like those used at Google, Meta, LinkedIn, and YouTube.
It demonstrates how to run rigorous tests, reduce variance, analyze retention, and model churn using both synthetic and real user data.
